# FirstCapStone

> The project I have completed is my first capstone project, which involved utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional web application. Throughout the project, I worked with these programming languages to design and develop the various elements of the application.

> The final product of my capstone project is a fully functional web application that includes interactive features and user-friendly design. Throughout the development process, I applied my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the necessary components and functionality for the application.

> Overall, this was an excellent opportunity for me to apply my programming skills and gain hands-on experience in creating a web application. I am proud of the final product and excited to continue building upon my knowledge in these programming languages for future projects.</div>
